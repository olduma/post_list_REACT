 This is a React application that displays a list of posts. The posts are stored in the app's state as an array of objects, with each object containing an id, a label, a boolean indicating if the post is important, and a boolean indicating if the post has been liked. The app allows users to add new posts, delete existing posts, and toggle the important and liked statuses of posts.  
 The app also includes a search panel that allows users to search for posts by typing in a search term. Additionally, users can filter the posts by status (all, liked). The header displays the number of posts and the number of liked posts, and the list of posts is displayed below the header.
